            <h3>WHAT IS OUR RETURN POLICY?</h3>
            <p>We market our shoes to help you find exactly what you need, so if they're not working exactly right for you, we've got you covered. Whether you shop online, we provide you 30 days to take your shoes purchases for a trial run, confidently knowing you can return any item (some exceptions apply) for any reason within those 30 days. Even after 30 days, you can still return items if theyâ€™re unworn and unwashed. And remember, returns are always free. </p>
